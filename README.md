# OpenGLWaterSimulation

# OpenGL implementation of previous water simulation research.

# Utilizing lessons from learnopengl.com in order to learn how to use OpenGL.

# Libraries in the repository must be linked to new Visual Studio projects otherwise errors will be thrown. Just include the "Includes" and "Libs" file in the VC++ settings for the project under the Includes and Library sections respectively. Then go to the Linker/Input settings and under additional dependencies add "opengl32.lib", "glfw3.lib", and "assimp-vc140-mt.lib" (do not include the "" in the names).
Potentially the libaries will not compile properly for a new computer. If this is the case, download, cmake, and link the llbraries on the new computer.
